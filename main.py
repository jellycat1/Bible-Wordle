All words will be in uppercase.
You will get six tries to guess a randomly picked word.
All words are from the Bible.
When you input a word, you will get your word colored.
If the background color of a letter in your word is gray, the letter is not in the word.
If the background color of a letter in your word is yellow, the letter is somewhere else in the word.
If the background color of a letter in your word is green, the letter is in the right place.
Every word is five letters long.
Enter q or quit to end the game.
Good luck!
